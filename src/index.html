      <h1>Zhenshuo Xu</h1>
      
      <p class ="text"> My name is Zhenshuo Xu. I just graduated from UC Davis with a bachelor's degree
        in Computer Science in December 2024, and this is my first year at UIUC.
          I'm particularly interested in machine learning, systems, and computer 
          graphics, and I hope to continue to develop my skills in these areas 
          during my time at UIUC.
          In my daily life, I enjoy photography, fitness, and trying new 
          technologies. I'm thrilled to meet you all here and look forward 
          to learning, collaborating, and connecting with you!</p>
